# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid, with the goal of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. This project demonstrates basic React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and event handling.
